# Robot CPP

This library is inspired by older unmaintained libraries like [octalmage/robotjs](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs)
and [Robot/robot-js](https://github.com/Robot/robot-js). The goal is to provide cross-platform controls for various
devices such as keyboards, mice, and screens for C++ application.
